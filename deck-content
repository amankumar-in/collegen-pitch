# Collegen: Campus Digital Economies
**Presented by Coins For College & Life**

## The Opportunity: Campus Economies Are Inevitable

**Colleges operate as closed-loop economies today:**
- 20+ million students making daily transactions
- Predictable financial flows: tuition, dining, housing, events
- Governance structures already in place
- High-trust communities with shared goals

**Current problems:**
- Fragmented payment systems across campus services
- Limited student participation in decision-making
- Alumni engagement drops after graduation
- No interoperability between institutions
- Manual processes for credentials and access

**The shift is already happening:** Digital-native students expect programmable, transparent systems.

## Solution: Modular Blockchain Infrastructure for Higher Education

**Collegen provides each college with:**
- Their own blockchain (College Chain)
- Their own digital currency (College Coin)
- Integration with existing campus systems
- Regulatory compliance framework
- Cross-campus interoperability

**Three core components:**
1. **College Chains** - Individual institutional blockchains
2. **TuitionCoin** - Network utility token powering all transactions
3. **Intuition Exchange** - Permissioned marketplace for cross-campus activity
